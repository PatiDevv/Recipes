    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375 or 400 degrees F.\r\n\r\nBake the potatoes until they are fork tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Check them!\r\n\r\nWhile the potatoes are still hot peel and pass them through a food mill or ricer. (I find that the food mill works just as well as a ricer and is much easier to handle) onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. When doing this pay careful attention to keep the potatoes as light and fluffy as possible. This will aid in keeping the gnocchi light. Refrigerate the potatoes on the sheet tray until cold. This is also a very important step. If the potatoes are warm while adding flour they will require more flour which will result in a much heavier finished product.\r\n\r\nWhen the potatoes are absolutely cold, transfer to a clean work surface. Beat together the eggs and cheese and pour onto the potatoes. Season with salt. Cover generously with flour. It should look like snow on the mountains.\r\n\r\nCrumble the potato flour mixture between your fingers. Begin to knead the dough until it is a dry homogeneous mixture. The dough should feel slightly moist, but not tacky. If too tacky, repeat the snow on the mountains stage.\r\n\r\nForm the dough into a large log. Cut slices off the log and begin to roll into long ropes that are about 1-inch in thickness. Cut the ropes into 0.5-inch lengths. Cover generously with flour. Place the gnocchi in a single layer on a sheet tray dusted with flour. DO NOT PILE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER!!\r\n\r\nUse or freeze the gnocchi immediately. If freezing, place tray directly into the freezer. Once frozen, the gnocchi can be stored in plastic bags, in the freezer, indefinitely. When cooking gnocchi they can go directly from the freezer into salted boiling water.\r\n\r\nNote: It is a general practice to take gnocchi out of the water when they float. This is a big mistake. Gnocchi need to be cooked in boiling water until they float and get nice and puffy. Not cooking gnocchi long enough will also result in heavy gnocchi.\r\n\r\nP.S. These are Chef Anne \"Secrets\" to great gnocchi, use them and you will be successful every time.\r\n\r\nRead more at: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/anne-burrell/gnocchi-with-prosciutto-spring-peas-and-chanterelles-recipe/index.html?oc=linkback",

Add salt and vanilla bean paste (or vanilla extract) and mix for a few seconds to combine.\r\n3. Add flour and mix for 1-2 minutes, until large crumbs form. Pour mixture out on to a work surface and knead several times until a smooth ball forms.\r\n4. Scoop up small balls of dough, about 2 tablespoons each. Roll each ball between the palms of your hands till you form smooth, round circles. Place dough balls on prepared cookie sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.\r\n5. Flatten each ball with a flat-bottomed glass to a disk about 0.5 inch thick.\r\n6. Make an indention, about 0.5 inch in diameter in the center of each dough disk. Use any round-ended utensil to make the indentions, such as the end of a wooden spoon or ice cream scoop.\r\n7. Place sheet pans with prepared cookies in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before baking. This will keep them from spreading out too much.\r\n8. Bake for 15-18 minutes or until beginning to turn golden at bottom edges.\r\n9. Remove to a wire cooling rack.\r\n10. Fill the center of each cookie with a generous rounded teaspoon of the caramel mixture.\r\n11. Sprinkle lightly with flaky sea salt. Allow to cool and “set” for at least an hour before serving.\r\n\r\nDirections for the caramel:\r\n1. Combine the butter, brown sugar, cane sugar, corn syrup and heavy cream. Bring to a boil stirring till dissolved.\r\n2. Reduce heat to a steady simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until mixture reaches 220?F* on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat and add vanilla. Stir well until smooth and bubbles disappear.",

When the pan is hot enough for a bead of water to instantly sizzle and evaporate, add just 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil and swirl to coat pan.\r\n\r\n2 Add the shrimp, quickly spreading out around the cooking surface area so that they are not overlapping. Let fry, untouched for 30 seconds. Flip over and let the other side fry for 30 seconds, or until about 80% cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the pan onto a plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.\r\n\r\n3 Turn the heat to medium, let the pan heat up again. Add the eggs, stirring in a quick motion to break up and scramble the eggs. When the eggs are almost cooked through (they should still be slightly runny in the middle), dish out of the pan into the same plate as the cooked shrimp.\r\n\r\n4 Use paper towels to wipe the same wok or sauté pan clean and return to high heat with the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, swirling to coat. When the oil is very hot, add the green onions and fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add in the rice and stir well to mix in the green onions throughout. Spread the rice all around the wok surface area and let the rice heat up, untouched until you hear the bottoms of the grains sizzle, about 1-2 minutes. Use the spatula to toss the rice, again spreading the rice out over the surface of wok.\r\n\r\n5 Drizzle the soy sauce all around the rice and toss. Add the peas and carrots, the cooked eggs, shrimp and sesame oil, tossing to mix the rice evenly with all of the ingredients. Let everything heat back up again, until the rice grains are so hot they practically dance! Taste and add an additional 1 teaspoon of soy sauce if needed.",

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the couscous. Cover the pan until the couscous is tender and all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 5 to 6 minutes. Put the couscous in a large bowl and add the beans, currants, spinach, feta and 0.25 cup olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir until all the ingredients are combined.\r\n\r\nSlice the tops off the peppers and remove all the ribs and seeds. If necessary, cut a very thin slice from the base to help the peppers stand up. Stuff the peppers with the filling and drizzle the tops with olive oil. Put the peppers in an 8 by 8-inch square baking dish. Fill the baking dish with 0.75-inch hot water and bake until the filling is golden and the peppers are cooked through, about 55 to 60 minutes.\r\n\r\nSauce: In a blender, combine the basil, creme fraiche, olive oil, water, garlic, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.\r\n\r\nRemove the peppers from the oven and arrange on serving plates. Spoon the sauce around the peppers and serve.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf using slow-cooker, skip the chicken broth and add the dry couscous and cumin directly to the bowl with the rest of the filling.  Cook in the slow cooker for 4 hours on High.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf using poblanos, instead preheat the oven to 475. Halve and clean the poblanos, cover in oil, salt, and pepper, and roast the halves for 11-13 minutes, until slightly softened. Remove from oven, but leave oven on.\r\n\r\nWhen filling is ready, pack into the poblano halves. Return to the oven for 5 minutes, until the peppers are softened.

Combine the cream cheese, sugar and flour in a small bowl, and mix until smooth. Add the egg yolk and flavoring (if using), mixing until smooth once again. Transfer the mixture to a disposable pastry bag, and cut just the very tip off the end, as shown.\r\n\r\n2. Place a small pool of the mixture in the center of the brownie batter. Draw circles around this pool, about 1 inch apart, moving out from the center each time.\r\n\r\n3. Once the circles are drawn, take a table knife, wet the tip, and draw it back and forth through the circles.\r\n\r\n4. The knife will draw the cream cheese filling into arcs, as you see here. Once you've gone all the way around the circles, take up your pastry bag again.\r\n\r\n5. Use the remaining filling to trace the path where the knife travelled, to create the spokes of the web.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the brownies for 30 minutes, until the brownies just barely pull away from the edge of the pan. The center will rise while baking, but will sink back level once the brownies are cool.

Or simply combine the butter and sugar, and heat, stirring, until the butter is melted. Continue to heat (or microwave) briefly, just until the mixture is hot (about 110°F to 120°F), but not bubbling; it'll become shiny looking as you stir it. Heating the mixture to this point will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies.\r\n\r\n4) Add the hot butter/sugar mixture to the egg/cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth.\r\n\r\n5) Add the flour and chips, again stirring until smooth. Note: If you want the chips to remain intact in the baked brownies, rather than melting in, let the batter cool in the bowl for about 20 minutes before stirring in the chips.\r\n\r\n6) Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 9\" x 13\" pan.\r\n\r\n7) Bake the brownies for about 30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, or with just a few moist crumbs clinging to it.

    "instructions": "1) Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.\r\n\r\n2) To make the cookies: Combine the sugars, peanut butter, shortening, salt, baking soda, and vanilla, beating until smooth.\r\n\r\n3) Add the egg, beating to combine.\r\n\r\n4) Stir in the oats and flour.\r\n\r\n5) Drop the dough by the heaping teaspoonful onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1.5\" between them. A teaspoon cookie scoop works well here.\r\n\r\n6) Using the flat bottom of a drinking glass dipped in sugar, flatten each cookie to about 0.25\" thickness, about 1.5\" diameter. If you're a fan of the popular sweet/salty flavor combo, sprinkle each cookie with the tiniest amount of extra-fine salt (or to taste; you know your own tolerance for saltiness).\r\n\r\n7) Bake the cookies for about 12 to 14 minutes, until they're a medium golden brown.\r\n\r\n8) Remove them from the oven, and transfer them to a rack to cool. Once they're cool, wrap airtight; they'll soften if left unwrapped.\r\n\r\n9) Decide which type of filling you want to use. Each recipe makes enough to fill all the cookies.\r\n\r\n10) To make the peanut butter filling: Mix all of the ingredients until smooth; a mini food processor works well here. If you're not using a food processor, sift the confectioners' sugar before stirring it together with the peanut butter and milk or half & half.\r\n\r\n11) To make the fudge filling: Combine the chocolate chips and half & half in a small, microwave-safe bowl; or in a small saucepan. Heat until the half & half is steaming. Remove from the heat, and stir until the chips have melted and the filling is smooth; reheat briefly if necessary.\r\n\r\n12) Spread the filling on half the cookies. Top with the remaining cookies.\r\n\r\nYield: about 22 filled cookies.",

Gently stir until the dough is evenly mixed; avoid overmixing.\r\n\r\nTransfer the biscuit dough to a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough into a 9-inch square about 0.5 inch thick. Cut the dough into 6 even strips in each direction, making 36 squares. Set the biscuits on the baking sheet about 1 inch apart. Bake until puffed and lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the biscuits to a wire rack to cool.\r\n\r\nCut each biscuit in half horizontally. Cut the smoked salmon into strips about 1 inch wide and a few inches long. Stir together the creme fraiche and lemon zest in small bowl.\r\n\r\nTo assemble the biscuits, fold the salmon strips into 1 inch squares and set them on the bottom portions of the biscuits, add a dollop of the creme fraiche, and top with the other biscuit halves. Arrange the biscuits on a platter or tray and serve.\r\n\r\nMakes 36 biscuits.\r\n\r\nTo double, double all the ingredients, making the biscuits in batches.\r\nBest not to halve but you can cut the biscuits into 16 pieces for larger portions.\r\nYou can make the biscuits 1 day ahead and store in an airtight container; split and fill not more than 1 hour before serving.",

To avoid heating the chocolate too much and possibly burning it, the best method is to heat until the butter is melted and the chocolate has partially melted, then remove from the heat. Stir until all the chocolate melts.\r\n\r\n2. In a separate bowl, beat together the sugar and eggs until they're thoroughly combined. Add the hot melted chocolate, then stir in the remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\n3. Refrigerate the batter-like dough until it's thoroughly chilled, about 3 hours (or overnight). It needs to set and stiffen up before it can be scooped into balls.\r\n\r\n4. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly grease two baking sheets, three if you have them. Or line sheets with parchment, and grease the parchment.\r\n\r\n5. Drop the cookie dough by heaping teaspoonfuls (balls about 1\" across) onto the prepared baking sheets. A teaspoon cookie scoop makes this task extremely simple. Leave about 2\" between the dough balls, as they'll spread as they bake.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the cookies for 10 to 11 minutes, until their tops are shiny and cracked. They won't crack until the very end, so keep a close eye on them; when they're cracked all the way across the top surface, they're just about done. The point is, you want these baked all the way through, but just barely; additional baking will make them crisp rather than chewy.\r\n\r\n7. Remove the cookies from the oven. After a few minutes, gently loosen them with a spatula, then let them finish cooling on the pan.\r\n\r\nYield: about 4 dozen 2\" cookies.",

Bake the tofu: arrange the tofu on the baking sheet in a single layer. Try to avoid the pieces touching each other. Bake until the outside of the tofu is golden and the pieces look slightly puffed, 20 to 45 minutes depending on the size and shape of your tofu. Toss the tofu every 10 minutes so the pieces bake evenly. The longer you bake the tofu, the chewier it will be.\r\n\r\n7.

Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, and the basil and cook until thickened and the tomatoes soften and break down. season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nTransfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Return the mixture to the saucepan, add the basil and chopped parsley, season with salt, pepper, and honey, if needed.\r\n\r\nFor the cauliflower sauce: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the florets from the head of cauliflower and put in a small roasting pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Add 1.5 cups water to the bottom of the pan, cover with foil, and cook until very tender, about 1 hour. Remove and increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F.\r\n\r\nMelt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 30 seconds. Slowly whisk in 4 cups of the milk, increase the heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the cauliflower, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 5 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Transfer the mixture to a blender (in batches) and puree until smooth. Strain the mixture into a clean saucepan through a medium mesh strainer and bring to a simmer over low heat. Whisk in the nutmeg, cheese, and salt and pepper, to taste. Cook for 1 minute. Add some of the remaining warm milk, if needed.\r\n\r\nFor the lasagna: Increase the oven to 375 degrees F. Combine the ricotta, egg, 0.5 cup parsley, 1 teaspoon thyme, and romano cheese in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.\r\n\r\nHeat the olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and cook until they begin to soften. Add the shallots and cook until golden brown and completely dry. Drain the porcini mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid, coarsely chop, and add to the mushrooms in the pan and cook for 1 minute. Deglaze with the porcini soaking liquid and cook until completely reduced. Stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons thyme, remaining 0.25 cup parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.\r\n\r\nTo assemble: Ladle some of the tomato sauce into the bottom of a 10 by 14 by 2.5-inch baking dish. Ladle some of the cauliflower mornay sauce over the tomato sauce. Top with 4 noodles. Top the noodles with some of the ricotta mixture, then some mushrooms, fontina, and romano. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat to make 4 layers. Ladle the cauliflower mornay sauce over the top of the noodles, making sure to cover the noodles completely with the sauce, and sprinkle with more of the romano cheese. Put the lasagna pan on a baking sheet, cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until bubbly and the top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes longer. Remove from the oven, sprinkle the top with parsley, and let rest 15 minutes before serving. Cut into squares and serve additional tomato sauce on the side.\r\n\r\nRecipe courtesy of Bobby Flay\r\n\r\nRead more at: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/wild-mushroom-and-cauliflower-lasagna-recipe.html?oc=linkback",

Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the berries are tender but still slightly chewy, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover, and steam for 10 to 15 minutes if you have time. Drain any remaining liquid and transfer to a large serving bowl to cool.\r\n\r\n2. While the wheat berries cool, prepare the salad. Bring the leeks, broth, and orange zest to a boil in a large saucepan. Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the leeks are soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain the leeks, and add them to the serving bowl with the wheat berries. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, 0.25 cup of the mint, and the capers, fennel seed, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning, keeping in mind that capers and haloumi are quite salty.\r\n\r\n3. To finish, position a rack about 6 inches below the heat source and preheat the broiler. Cut the haloumi cheese into thin slices, about 0.25 inch thick, and put them on a plate. Sprinkle with the oregano, pepper, pepper flakes, and reserved tomato oil; rub the oil and spices all over to coat the slices on both sides (work gently, as haloumi breaks easily). Transfer the cheese to a medium cast-iron skillet or a broiler pan.\r\n\r\n4. Broil the haloumi until the slices just start to brown at the edges, about 5 minutes, turning once with a spatula. (Watch closely as you don't want the cheese to dry out.)\r\n\r\n5. Top the salad with the haloumi. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons mint, and serve right away.\r\n\r\nTo get a head start: Make the wheat berries, as in step 1, ahead. The salad (without the haloumi) can be prepared 4 to 6 hours ahead. Chill, covered. Bring to room temperature before serving.",

Turn the heat up to the highest setting and add the peppers to the pan. Stir-fry with a spatula or long chopsticks. Sprinkle in some salt--this draws out moisture from the vegetables and cooks them a bit faster. Continue stir-frying for 4-5 minutes, until the peppers are cooked.\r\n\r\n2. Push the vegetables to the sides of the pan, and add the seitan to the exposed bottom. Leave for a couple of minutes, then turn over to cook the other side. Stir everything together, and add black pepper and soy sauce.\r\n\r\nFor instant cabbage and cucumber pickles:\r\n\r\n1. cut out the tough vein of the cabbage leaf, and slice the rest into strips. Sprinkle the cabbage and cucumber with the salt and massage well with your hands until the vegetables go limp. Let rest for at least 5 minutes. Add a squeeze of lemon juice.\r\n\r\n2. Squeeze out any excess moisture before packing into a bento box. I like to put the pickles in a bento divider cup or cupcake liner to prevent the flavors from mingling with other flavors in the box.\r\n\r\nFor Blanched Broccoli:\r\n\r\n1. Put just enough water in a small pan to cover the broccoli. Bring the water to a boil, add a pinch of salt, and put in the broccoli florets. Boil for 2-3 minutes, drain the water, and run cold tap water over the broccoli to cool quickly and fix the bright green color. Drain well.

    "instructions": "For Basic Tamagoyaki:\r\n\r\n1. Mix together all of the tamagoyaki ingredients, except for the oil, until the egg yolk and white are amalgamated but not frothy.\r\n\r\n2. Heat up the frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour in some oil and tilt the pan to spread it around. Take a small wad of paper towel and rub it around the pan to soak up any excess oil. Put the oil soaked wad on a small plate next to the stove.\r\n\r\n3. Use cooking chopsticks or a fork to draw a little of the egg mixture along the bottom of the pan. If the egg cooks immediately, the pan is hot enough and ready to go. If the egg browns too fast, cool the pan down by putting the bottom of the pan on a moistened kitchen towel, and lower the heat a little.\r\n\r\n4. Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the hot pan. Tilt the pan to spread it around the bottom. Pierce any large bubbles that form with the chopsticks or fork.\r\n\r\n5. As soon as the egg starts to set, start rolling it to one side of the pan. Flip one end over with the chopsticks or fork and keep flipping until you have a skinny roll. If you can't roll the egg, you can just push it along to one side until you have a skinny little omelette.\r\n\r\n6. Leaving the first roll at one side of the pan, rub the oil-soaked wad of paper towel firmly along the bottom of the pan. This adds just enough lubrication while also cleaning up any stray bits of egg.\r\n\r\n7. Add a little more of the egg mixture to the pan, tilting the pan around to spread it. Life the first roll up a little so that the uncooked egg runs beneath it.\r\n\r\n8. Puncture any large air bubbles that form, as before. As soon as this layer starts to set on top, roll it around the cooked egg roll to the opposite side of the pan. As before, if the egg is browning too fast, place the pan on a moistened towel for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n9. Repeat the preceding three steps until the egg mixture is all used up. The thinner the layers, the more delicately textured the tamagoyaki will be. Try to do a minimum of 4-5 layers.\r\n\r\n10. When the tamagoyaki is done, turn seam-side down into the pan and press briefly to seal it. Flip the egg out onto a sushi mat or paper towel.\r\n\r\n11. Roll the sushi mat or towel around the tamagoyaki, forming a rectangular shape. Leave to cool.\r\n\r\n12. Cut into even slices before packing. Garnish with parsley.\r\n\r\n13. Don't despair if your tamagoyaki doesn't quite look perfect. It will still taste great! Leftovers can be refrigerated, tightly wrapped, for a day or two.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Salami and Cream Cheese Rolls:\r\n\r\n1. Peel the carrot and cut into strips to same thickness and length as the green beans.\r\n\r\n2. Bring a pot or pan of water to a rapid boil. Add carrots and green beans, boil for 3-4 minutes until crisp-tender. Drain and rinse in cold water to stop the cooking.\r\n\r\n3. On each piece of salami, place a dollop of cream cheese, a green bean, and a stick or two of carrot. Roll into a little burrito. (If necessary, cut a toothpick in half and use it to pin the salami closed.)\r\n\r\n4. If you have leftover carrots or green beans, dice them for sprinkling over the rice.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Rice:\r\n\r\n1. Pack rice into bento box and sprinkle with the excess vegetables.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Garlic Sauteed Spinach:\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30s-1m, until fragrant and infusing the oil.\r\n\r\n2. Add the spinach and stir-fry rapidly. It will shrink down in mass in no time. When done, turn off heat, season with salt, pepper, and red pepper, and let cool.\r\n\r\n3. Pack into a bento cup for serving.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTo instead prepare as a rice bowl (when you're eating it fresh rather than prepping a bento for later), just put the rice serving in a bowl. Fry the eggs, to a soft/gooey yolk, and put on top of rice. Dice the veggies after boiling, add to the spinach during cooking, and put the whole mixture on top of the eggs. Finally, large dice the salami and small-cube the cream cheese, and put on top of the bowl.\r\n\r\nIf you want a little more kick, add togarashi to the eggs, and/or drizzle some sriracha or other chili sauce on top of the bowl when done.

Have ready an ungreased large tube pan (9-inch diameter, 16-cup capacity), preferably with a removable bottom. If the pan bottom is not removable, line it with parchment or wax paper.\r\n\r\n2. In a small bowl, whisk the flour with 0.75 cup sugar. Place remaining 0.75 cup sugar in another small bowl next to the mixer.\r\n\r\n3. In the bowl of a standing mixer, or with a handheld mixer, beat egg whites at low speed until just broken up and beginning to froth. Add cream of tartar and salt and beat at medium speed until whites form very soft, billowy mounds. With the mixer still at medium speed, beat in 0.75 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all sugar is added and whites are shiny and form soft peaks. Add vanilla, lemon juice, and almond extract and beat until just blended.\r\n\r\n4. Place flour-sugar mixture in a sifter set over waxed paper. Sift flour-sugar mixture over egg whites about 3 tablespoons at a time, and gently fold it in, using a large rubber spatula. Sift any flour-sugar mixture that falls onto the paper back into the bowl with the whites.\r\n\r\n5. Gently scrape batter into pan, smooth the top, and give pan a couple of raps on the counter to release any large air bubbles.\r\n\r\n6. Bake until the cake is golden brown and the top springs back when pressed firmly, 50 to 60 minutes.\r\n\r\n7. If cake pan has prongs around the rim for elevating the cake, invert pan onto them. If not, invert pan over the neck of a bottle or funnel so that air can circulate all around it. Let the cake cool completely, 2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\n8. To unmold, run a knife around edges, being careful not to separate the golden crust from the cake. Slide cake out of pan and cut the same way around removable bottom to release, or peel off parchment or wax paper, if used.\r\n\r\n9. Place the cake, bottom-side up, on a platter. Cut slices by sawing gently with a serrated knife. Serve the cake the day it is made.\r\n\r\nRead more: http://www.livestrong.com/recipes/the-best-angel-food-cake-cooks-illustrated/#ixzz4PHieOlr4",

    "instructions": "Pack **rice** into bento box and allow to cool while prepping remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\nMake tiny cuts along the inside of each **shrimp** (opposite site to where the vein was) and gently pull the shrimp straight. This is an optional step, but it does make the shrimp look much bigger.\r\n\r\nPat the shrimps dry, and season with a little salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nPut the **potato starch** in one plate, the **beaten egg** in a small bowl, and the **panko bread crumbs** on another plate. Have another plate ready, lined with a couple of paper towels.\r\n\r\nHeat 0.5 inch of vegetable oil in a small frying pan over high heat. The oil is hot enough when a panko bread crumb dropped into it turns light brown right away.\r\n\r\nWorking rapidly, coat the shrimps in the cornstarch, dip in the egg,then roll in the bread crumbs. Try to do this with one hand, leaving the other hand clean to hold a pair of chopsticks or tongs to turn the shrimps. Gently put the shrimps one by one into the hot oil. Turn after a minute, and cook for another 30 seconds to a minute on the other side. The shrimps should feel firm when lightly tapped with the chopsticks.\r\n\r\nAs soon as each shrimp is cooked, remove from the oil and drain on the paper towels. Sprinkle with salt while still hot. Leave the shrimps to cool thoroughly before packing into a bento box.\r\n\r\n\r\nAhead of time note: Bread the shrimps and freeze in a single layer, ideally on a metal baking sheet. Once the shrimps are frozen stiff, pack them in freezer bags or containers. Frozen breaded shrimps should be cooked for 2-3 minutes longer than fresh.\r\n\r\nFor **broccoli**, cook or blanch to desired doneness, then let cool. Combine the rest of the ingredients, then mix with the cooled broccoli.\r\n\r\nTo pack bento:\r\n\r\nPut the **dipping sauce** of your choice in the sauce cup, to tuck into a corner of the bento box. Pack **carrot and celeriac salad** and **dressed broccoli**. Place shrimp on top of rice, if possible.",

    "instructions": "FOR THE DOUGH\r\n\r\n1. Combine the egg yolks, whole egg, sugar, butter and buttermilk in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk at medium speed.\r\n2. As the mixture comes together add 10 ounces of the flour, along with the yeast and salt and continue whisking until combined.\r\n3. Remove the whisk attachment and replace it with a dough hook. Add another 4 ounces of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. At this point the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. If it is sticky, add a bit more flour (one ounce at a time). Knead on low for another 5 minutes or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl.\r\n4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; and form dough into a smooth ball. Transfer to a large bowl that has been lightly lubed with the vegetable oil. Rotate the bowl so that the dough ball is evenly covered. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours. (Exact times will vary depending on the temperature of the room and the temperature of the ingredients.)\r\n\r\nFOR THE FILLING\r\n\r\n1. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.\r\n\r\nTO ASSEMBLE\r\n\r\n1. Butter a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish with the cold butter.\r\n2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently shape into a rectangle with the long side nearest you. Then use a rolling pin to shape into 18 by 12-inch rectangle.\r\n3. Brush the dough with the the melted butter, leaving a 1-inch border along the top edge.\r\n4. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the dough, also avoiding the top border.\r\n5. Gently press the filling into the dough. (If you tend to have hot hands, you may want to cover the filling with a layer of plastic wrap first.)\r\n6. Beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder. Firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll the cylinder seam side down. Very gently squeeze the cylinder to create even thickness.\r\n8. Using a serrated knife, gently cut the cylinder into 2-inch rolls; yielding 8 pieces.\r\n9. Arrange rolls cut side down in the baking dish; cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 16 hours.\r\n\r\nTO BAKE\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees F.\r\n2. When the oven has reached 200 degrees F, turn it off and place the rolls in the turned-off oven. Let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.\r\n3. Without taking the rolls out of the oven, increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and let the rolls continue to bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F. Remove the rolls and let cool while you make the icing.\r\n\r\nFOR THE ICING\r\n\r\n1. Whisk the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar, and whisk until smooth. Spread over the rolls and serve immediately.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nIn case there are leftovers, arrange them on a plate and cover thoroughly with plastic wrap for up to 3 days. To reheat, move to a small plate (I usually use a paper plate) and microwave on high for 30 seconds. Two rolls can be reheated this way, three may require a few seconds more. Four will ... let's face it, you're not going to have that many left over and you know it.\r\n\r\nTo freeze: Individually wrap the rolls in plastic wrap and place them in a zip-top freezer-safe bag. When ready to eat, uncover and defrost on the counter for an hour. Then microwave for 30 seconds.",

Wipe out the pan.\r\n\r\nIn the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium until hot. Crack the eggs into the pan, keeping them separate. Season with salt and as much of the remaining spice blend as you'd like, depending on how spicy you'd like the dish to be. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are cooked to your desired degree of doneness. Turn off the heat.\r\n\r\nPlace the radishes in a bowl; drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss to thoroughly coat.

Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is unevenly crumbly, with some of the butter remaining in larger pieces.\r\n\r\nMix in the cheese, chives, and bacon until evenly distributed.\r\n\r\nAdd ¾ cup of the cream, stirring to combine. Try squeezing the dough together; if it's crumbly and won't hang together, or if there are crumbs remaining in the bottom of the bowl, add cream until the dough comes together. Transfer the shaggy dough to a well-floured work surface.\r\n\r\nPat the dough into a smooth 7\" disk about 0.75\" thick. Transfer the disk to the prepared baking sheet. Use a knife or bench knife to cut the disk into 8 wedges, spreading the wedges apart a bit on the pan.\r\nBrush the scones with a bit of cream; this will help their crust brown.\r\n\r\nBake the scones for 22 to 24 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool right on the pan. Serve warm, or at room temperature.\r\n\r\nTips:\r\nWant to make scones now, freeze and bake later? Make scones up to the point they're on the baking sheet, cut and ready to bake; don't brush them with cream. Freeze, then remove from the sheet, and wrap airtight in a plastic bag. When you're ready to bake, remove however many you want to bake from the freezer, place on a baking sheet, brush with cream, and bake in a preheated 425°F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown.\r\n\r\nMake mini-scones: Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into a 5\" round. Cut each round into 8 wedges. Bake in a preheated 425°F oven till golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes; or for about 25 minutes if frozen.",

    "instructions": "Cook rice: \r\n1. However much cooked rice you need, start with half that of dry rice.\r\n2. Rinse rice to remove starchy coating.\r\n3. Mix with ~1.7x water and a heavy pinch of salt.\r\n4. Boil until done, 20ish minutes.\r\n\r\nFor the tofu:\r\n1. Set the oven to 400° F and line a baking tray with baking paper. \r\n2. Toast panko breadcrumbs in a small pan until golden (they will gain more colour in the oven). \r\n3. Cut tofu into thin blocks; ideally equal to # of servings, but if the tofu blocks are narrow, twice that. Sprinkle tofu with some soy sauce or you can season the flour with plenty of salt instead. \r\n4. Drag tofu in flour making sure that the entire surface area has been coated. Dip the tofu in the egg and finally drag it in the pre-toasted breadcrumbs. \r\n5. Brush a bit of oil on the baking paper underneath the tofu and bake for about 10 minutes per side, flipping halfway thru.\r\n\r\nTo assemble:\r\n\r\n1. Cut a square of cling film slightly larger than your nori sheet. Place it on the table, place the nori sheet on top with the shiny side down and rotated 45° in relation to the cling film.\r\n2. Wet your hands (keep a small bowl of water handy to wet your hands) and grab a handful of rice. Place it in the middle of the sheet and using your hands form it into a compacted square (about 9 cm / 3.5 ” by 9 cm / 3.5 “). Try to make that layer as even and compacted as possible. Season well with salt. (Ideally, use an onigirazu mold.)\r\n3. Top with tofu, mayo, then veggies, and finally a second layer of rice.\r\n4. Fold the nori corners over the stack, using the cling film to help keep it together without tearing, until you get a small packet.\r\n5. Finally gather all the cling film over the stack and tie on the top. Put something moderately heavy (like a breadboard) on the onigirazu and set it aside to let the seaweed soften a little. Cut in half with a sharp knife.",

Add the flour and Pizza Dough Flavor, starting with 5 0.5 cups flour and adding more as necessary to make a soft, smooth dough.\r\n\r\n3. Knead the dough (with your hands, a mixer, or your bread machine set on the dough cycle) until it's smooth and elastic, about 7 to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n4. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other container, cover it, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, whatever fits your schedule.\r\n\r\n5. Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece, on a lightly greased surface, into a circle to fit a 12\" pizza pan. Let the dough rest several times to relax it and make it more cooperative. If you prefer a more artisan look to your crust, with scattered random air pockets throughout, hand-stretch the dough to size. Again, letting it rest periodically makes the job easier.\r\n\r\n6. Place the rounds on pizza pans; on baking sheets; or, if you have a pizza stone in your oven, on parchment.\r\n\r\n7. Preheat your oven to 450°F. While it's heating, get out your toppings, which you've prepared ahead. \r\n\r\n8. Brush each crust with a bit of olive oil; spread pizza or spaghetti sauce lightly over the surface, and let your guests add their favorite toppings. Sprinkle the top with grated cheese.\r\nBake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown, the toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. Remove the pizzas from the oven.\r\n\r\n9. Immediately transfer pizzas to a cooling rack, so their bottoms don't get soggy. After about 10 minutes (to allow the toppings to set), slice and serve; a pair of scissors is a great cutting tool.\r\n\r\nYield: 4 12\" pizzas, 6 to 8 servings each.\r\nTo freeze: After dividing dough in step 5, wrap ball of dough in plastic wrap and freeze. Allow to defrost in refrigerator and then set out at room temperature for about 30 minutes before shaping crust.",

Cover beans with water, so the water level is a couple of inches above the beans, and bring to a boil, then turn heat down so it’s simmering gently. Put a lid on the pot, and cook until beans are tender, adding more water as needed to keep the beans submerged. This could take 1 to 2 hours or more, depending on the beans and whether or not you soaked them.\r\n\r\nUse a spoon to fish out the onion and garlic; discard. In a small bowl, whisk together the miso and and a little bean broth until smooth. Add back to beans. Taste a couple of beans along with the broth. It should be opaque and slightly creamy; adjust the seasoning with more salt if needed.\r\n\r\nBrush both sides of each piece of bread with olive oil, and place on a foil-lined sheet pan. Run the pan under the broiler for 2 minutes, so the bread is crisp at the edges and nicely toasted, then flip bread and repeat. While the bread is still hot, rub a garlic clove along one side of each piece, as if you were grating the garlic on the bread, pushing just firmly enough for the clove to fray and dissolve slightly into the bread.\r\n\r\nTo assemble, place a piece of bread at the bottom of four wide, shallow bowls and ladle hot beans and broth on top. Wait a few seconds for the bread to absorb some broth, then ladle a little extra on each one, so it’s swimming.

Season to taste with kosher\r\n\r\nOnce the water reaches a boil, gently drop in all eggs and let the water come back to a boil. As soon as it does so, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the eggs at a gentle simmer, 8 minutes. Transfer half of the soft-boiled eggs to one ice bath. Continue to cook the remaining eggs until hard-boiled, another 6 minutes, then transfer them to the second ice bath. Let sit, 5 minutes. Crack all cooked egg shells by gently hitting them all over with the back of a spoon.\r\n\r\nWorking directly in the bowl, peel the hard-boiled eggs, keeping them partly immersed (the water helps loosen the shells). Transfer the hard-boiled eggs to a cutting board and chop them into 0.25-inch pieces. Gently fold the chopped eggs into the egg salad dressing using a rubber spatula. Season to taste with kosher salt.\r\n\r\nWorking directly in the second bowl, carefully peel the soft-boiled eggs. Transfer the peeled eggs to the cutting board and slice them in half lengthwise. The yolks should be creamy but not runny. If the yolks are runny, make another batch of soft-boiled eggs. (You’ll only need 1 soft-boiled egg per sandwich, so snack on any extra or imperfectly peeled pieces with some flaky sea salt, if desired.)\r\n\r\nSlather mustard on 1 side of 4 bread slices and mayonnaise on 1 side of the remaining 4 bread slices. \r\n\r\nSprinkle flaky sea salt on the halved soft-boiled eggs. Arrange 2 halves down the center of each slice of mustard-slathered bread, laying them yolk side down, and positioning them so the narrower tips point outward toward the crust of the bread and the wider, rounder portions (with the yolks) are in the middle of the bread. Place both halves close enough so that they touch in the center of the bread.\r\n\r\nDivide the egg salad among the sandwiches, gently plopping 0.5-cup scoops of egg salad on top of each pair of soft-boiled eggs on each of the 4 bread slices. Using an offset spatula, spread the egg salad evenly toward the crusts in all directions until bread is covered.\r\n\r\nTop with the remaining slices of bread, mayonnaise side down. Using a serrated knife, carefully slice the crusts off on the left and the right sides of each sandwich. (These should be the 2 sides that are parallel to the soft-boiled eggs.)\r\n\r\nRotate each sandwich 90 degrees and cut each sandwich into thirds, cutting parallel to the crust sides of the sandwiches, creating a beautiful exposed cross section.

Stir gently. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes until noodles are cooked through, a bit past the al dente stage.\r\n\r\nDrain the noodles and rinse under cold water to cool quickly. Rinse until noodles are smooth and firm and not at all sticky. Allow noodle to drain in colander while the rest is being prepped.\r\n\r\nFor dipping sauce: combine dashi and kaeshi. Pack in a leak-proof container.\r\n\r\nFor crab salad: Massage the cabbage with the salt until the cabbage has wilted. Squeeze well to expel excess moisture. Put in a bowl, add the vinegar and sugar, and mix. Add the crab and taste; add a little more salt if needed. Sprinkle with sansho or black pepper.\r\n\r\nTo pack: Put the noodles in one compartment, sprinkle with green onion, keep nori and sesame seeds separate. Pack crab and cabbage salad in a divider cup. Halve egg and pack near noodles. Fill in any gaps with cherry tomatoes.",
